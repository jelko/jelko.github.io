# tapedeck

*tapedeck* investigates the interaction with physical tokens as artefacts for virtual entities. The device is a playback system of streaming music, that is controlled through a collection of 3,5" floppy disks.

*The project experiments with matters of materiality and virtuality. Playing with "historic" interaction of records and data, tapedeck reintroduces a haptic sense and affords a collection in the physical. Nonetheless at it's core the device makes use of digital distribution and playback, touching the limitations of ownership, availability and expression.*

Todays music is often produced and consumed digitally end-to-end. Physical records that function as delivery, collectable and playback medium are a sign of the past. The availability of high-speed internet connectivity, delivery services and more connected playback devices shape todays listening experience. Collections are kept on computers and playback is arranged primarily via on-screen interactions.

*tapedeck* offers a alternative experience of collecting and listening to music. The internet-connected device can playback music from various online services (like Spotify and Soundcloud). 3,5" floppy discs function as physical pointers to a online music source. The playback interaction is entirely screen-less and offers just a minimal set of functions.

The front side affords two buttons and a slot to insert a floppy disk. When inserted, a third button allows the ejection the disk. The interaction is simple: Insert disk â†’ Playback starts.
The buttons allow to skip a track, or jump back to the previous one if the disk contains a set of tracks (i.e. a album or playlist).

The hardware is constructed of a Raspberry Pi (3rd generation), a HiFiBerry DAC+ audio interface and a generic USB floppy drive. Audio out is provided via RCA connectors.
Enclosing the inner parts, the device features a laser cut enclosure. Sketches of the design where prepared in Fusion 360 and then sliced for 5 mm acrylic sheets. The acrylic layers are connected by 4 M screws. The top layer serves also as a disk stand.

The Pi runs standard Raspbian with [Mopidy](https://www.mopidy.com/), a python audio server. Mopidy comes with interfaces / plugins for all popular streaming services, already doing a lot of the work. Extended by a [custom frontend](http://github.com/jelko/tapedeck) the software handles the interactions with the floppy drive, which is triggered by a simple `udev` rule.
