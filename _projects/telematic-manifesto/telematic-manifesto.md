This work is practice and realization; experiment and result: a performative sound piece, that emerged in front of the background of O’Sullivans manifest and deleuzian thought.
It is looking for the activation of the actual, the immanence of the material (certainly of our infrastructures), the uncovering of the virtual, the obsolete and the unthought-of. Subject to temporal, auditive and materialistic entanglements, this became immediately a performance full of noise, stuttering, folding and revolution.
