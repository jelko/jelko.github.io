# token-based search interface for biomedical researchers

{:.meta}
2016 at Edenspiekermann, with Boyd Emmen and Kay Hooijmans

Biomedical researchers and practitioners, that practise evidence-based medicine, need to find clinical studies for a certain set of parameters. They use the PICO (patient, problem or population; intervention; comparison, control or comparator; outcome) process to frame and answer their questions.
*Embase* is a scientific database for biomedical research.

We design and engineered a advanced new search interface based on tokens, which encapsulated the complex search syntax into a easy to learn and comprehandsable experience.

The resulting prototype was usability tested with a global set of users and iterated over multiple times. Our work was implemented and published on embase.com in early 2016.
