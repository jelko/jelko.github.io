{{ page.year }} at Edenspiekermann, with [Peter Curet](https://www.petercuret.com/), [Marija Erjavec](http://marijaerjavec.com/) and [Thijs Krooswijk](http://www.thijskrooswijk.com/)

We build a job listings and application page. Pretty simple. More importantly we restructured and consolidated the internal process of handling applications and reviews. On the way we had the chance, and huge pleasure, to work across the offices (Amsterdam and Berlin) and ship a product that unifies peoples and talents in several manners.
