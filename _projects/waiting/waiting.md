# please wait.

*on the aesthetics of dwelling and the discovery of slowness*

B.Sc. thesis, supervised by Prof. Frieder Nake and Prof. Peter von Maydell.

*please wait* is an essay on the temporal no-more and not-yet. On the halts, breaks and pauses, that sneak into our filled and throughly planed lives. It searches for the wonderful and beautiful: gifted time.

> Waiting for a train to go or a bus to come,<br/>
or a plane to go or the mail to come,<br/>
or the rain to go or the phone to ring,<br/>
or the snow to snow or waiting around for a Yes or No<br/>
or waiting for their hair to grow.<br/><br/>
Everyone is just waiting.<br/><br/>
Waiting for the fish to bite<br/>
or waiting for wind to fly a kite<br/>
or waiting around for Friday night<br/><br/>
or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake<br/>
or a pot to boil, or a Better Break<br/>
or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants<br/>
or a wig with curls, or Another Chance.<br/><br/>
Everyone is just waiting.
