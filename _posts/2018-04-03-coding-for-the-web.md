# notes

## Get your name on the internet. A domain.
* Figure out a name and check if it is available. (If you feel funky: Consider a new-style TLD like .studio, .party or .digital, apart from .com, .org, .de, .eu.)
* Register the name with a registrar of your choice. Recommendations: [regfish.de](https://www.regfish.de/), [namescheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/), [febas.de](https://www.febas.de/)
(Remember that you don't need to register the domain with the same company that is doing your webhosting. Sometimes its good to keep things separated. The only thing the register should include is unrestricted DNS Service.)

## I don't want to code. I just want to get a portfolio online.
Great choice! Seriously.

Use: [cargocollective.com](https://cargocollective.com/), [Behance Student Show](http://www.studentshow.com/), [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/students/) (HfK Discount Available), [Indexhibit](https://www.indexhibit.org/), Tumblr or Wordpress.com

## Okay. I do want to code and need a space to put my site. Webhosting.

* If you have a **static site** (plain HTML, CSS and JS) use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). They give you **free** webhosting. (And also support Jekyll.) Alternative: [Surge.sh](http://surge.sh/).
* If you have a more complex setup, running a CMS (like Wordpress or Kirby) or a dynamic site you need a server that fits your needs. Recommendations: [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de/) (cool people, non-profit, cheap, some knowlage required), [Raidboxes](https://raidboxes.de/) (optimized for Wordpress). Heroku (for Python, Ruby, Node.js sites, very good, not cheap, advanced).
* Since you are a **student** here. Use the things that the universities give you for **free**: Our very own [Matilde Server](http://matilde.hfk-bremen.de/), free and easy [webhosting from FB3](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/t/homepage-new) or [Webhosting for HfK Projects from Dez. 5](http://www.hfk-bremen.de/en/node/821).
