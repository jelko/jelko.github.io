# Schietwettermaschine

2017, in collaboration with Lukas Leck

The *Schietwettermaschine* (~ shit-weather-maschine) is a simulation of typical Bremen weather: Rain. The installation was part of a concept store that showcased Bremen in various ways and tied to deliver a authentic impression of the city to the visitor.
