# discovering a natural navigation experience

2015

We went on a search for a better way to navigate the city. We developed a concept & prototype, called wayght. It got nominated for the »Hochschulpreis« (award) at University of the Arts.

With a self-experiment we studied the typical navigation methods in the city. Three members of the team went on a food walk from the university to a common destination (the tv tower of Bremen). Every one with a different method: 
A) with a simple map
B) with turn-by-turn navigation from Google Maps
C) without anything, just vision and sense

(Of course none of them knew the way to get there before hand.)

Our Result: Wayfinding without any help (map or device) is the »easiest« and in our case the fastest as well. 
More importantly though: this is the only way the person really discovers the environment and learns to orient themselves. We call this »natural navigation«.

But what if you don't know the city at all? What if your destination is not as visible as a tv tower? How could we help someone to have a »natural navigation« experience?

The goal we set was to develop a system or device that enables and supports natural navigation. It should be super-intuitive, non-visual and universal.
We got inspired by one of the oldest navigation devices. The compass. Our device prototype is similar to a compass, which a user can sense by weight. A metal ball inside the device points at a fixed geographic direction (probably your destination).

The prototype was build with a Arduino Uno, a 3D printed using a MakerBot and a servo motor.
To set the geographic destination we designed a companion app.

## What we've learned from it

The idea of »natural navigation« has a lot of merit. We still believe that the current forms of navigation are too map and device focused and ultimately deliver a bad user experience, since the user is depended on the device.
Our prototype however was far from perfect. The weight inside was not as sensible as it should have been. Maybe another medium or input method has to be found.

The concept & prototype was displayed in the interaction lab at »Hochschultage 2015«.

## Tools used

* Arduino Uno
* MakerBot
* Servo Motor
* Sketch & Photoshop


I had a great time with this project in a great team with Florian Schröder, Niklas Barning and Laura Spillner. Focusing mainly on concept and UI design.
