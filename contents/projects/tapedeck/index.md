*Token-based interface for music* explores the interaction of physical manifestations as a representation of virtual entities.

Todays music is often produced and consumed digitally end-to-end. Physical records that function as delivery, collectable and playback medium are a sign of the past. The availability of high-speed internet connectivity, delivery services and more connected playback devices shape todays listening experience. Collections are kept on computers and playback is arranged primarily by on-screen interactions.

TBIFM explores a alternative experience of collecting and listening to music. The internet-connected device can playback music from varoius online services (like Spotify and Soundcloud). 3,5â€³ floppy discs function as physical pointers to a virtual music sources. The playback interaction is entirely screen-less and offers just a minimal set of fuctions.

The project experiments with matters of materiality and virtuality. Playing with historic interaction of records and data, TBIFM reintroduces a hapic sense and affords a collection in the physical. Nonetheless at it`s core the device makes use of digital distribution and playback, touching the limitations of ownership, availibilty and expression.
